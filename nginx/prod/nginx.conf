# Not sure about this, HEROKU says you have two processes on free plan: 1 web

# be set to  'auto' or better find out, what the maximum number is and what
# might be the consequences when exceeding that number. Heroku dynos have at
# least four cores. -> note from the example repo owners
worker_processes 4; # maybe better when unclear: 'auto' (which is also default configuraturion from nginx)
