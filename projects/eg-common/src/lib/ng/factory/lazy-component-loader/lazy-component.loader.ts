   * This approach makes sure, that the Component is instantiated via its module
   * and not via the root module. This is necessary to have the dependencies of
   * the lazy components module resolved.
   * https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/35759#issuecomment-601444856.
   *
   * This lazy loading technique will create a new instance of the lazy
   * components module each time, which may not be desirable. Consider caching
   * the ngModule somewhere (or even just factory in this case) but keep in mind
   * that this instance is specific to a parent Injector, which is the injector
   * of the provided lazyComponentContainer
   *
   * Disclaimer: Use this with caution. See the last paragraph. At this point I
   * am not sure when reusing the compiled module/moduleFactory would be
   * recommended and when not. The module is created with the injector of the
   * provided lazyComponentContainer. If I have two different containers within
   * a parent component, one for showing Component A and one for Component B and
   * both components belong to the same module, would it be ok to cache the
   * module when created for Component A and its container injector and then
   * reuse if for creating Component B, even though Component B will be in a
   * different container and the injector might be different? The impact of the
   * injector is not clear to me. In doubt, I would prefer creating the module
   * twice as long as it does not need to be a singleton.
