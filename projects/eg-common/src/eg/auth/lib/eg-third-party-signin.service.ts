   * This will open a new window to make the backend call for the Google Signin.
   * A new window was necessary, otherwise the Google redirect is blocked due to
   * CORS. If the user has not yet granted the app to signin with google, the
   * new window will show the Google acknowledgment screen. If the user already
   * granted access, the window will be blank. If the user chooses to close the
   * window without consent, the user will stay on its current page without any
   * error being thrown. When giving consent, Google will redirect to the
   * defined backend URL and the backend will call our frontend URL
   * 'auth/third-party-signin' with the result. For this URL the
   * EgThirdPartySigninGuard is active and will check if the current window
   * (which in this case will be the opened Google consent window) has a
   * window.opener (which would be the application instance that was used to
   * initiate the Google signin). If such an opener is present, the guard sends
   * a message to the window of the opener to indicate that the signin process
   * finshed.
   *
   * This method observes the incoming window messages and if a message from the
   * EgThirdPartySigninGuard comes in, the Google consent window will be closed.
   * The guard will forward a message that contains an access token, if signin
   * on server side was successful. This token will be used to init the session.
   *
   * @returns Observable that completes after firing one value. Return value
   * 'true' will indicate, that the user successfully signed in and the
   * application is in a state where authentication protected routes can be
   * accessed. Return value 'false' indicates that the signin process was not
   * sucessfull and the user is not authenticated yet.
